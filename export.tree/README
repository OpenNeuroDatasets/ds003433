Each subject has two localizer runs except for sub-16, which has only one.

Subject numbers are mapped across the newbi4fmri datasets uploaded in December 2020. For example, sub-01 in the localizer is also sub-01 in the main experiment. For this reason, some datasets do not contain continuous subject numbers.
